However, since 2008, several hundred corrections have been made and additional information added. Thus 86 of the 2008 voyages have been deleted either because we found they had been entered twice, or because we discovered that a voyage was not involved in the transatlantic slave trade. Voyage id 16772, the Pye, Captain Adam, turned out to have carried slaves from Jamaica to the Chesapeake, but obtained its captives in Jamaica, not Africa. Offsetting the deletions are 94 voyages added on the basis of new information. Further many voyages that are common to both 2008 and 2010 versions of the database contain information that was not available in 2008 (see table 1 of &ldquo;Understanding the Database&rdquo;). The 2010 version has 276 variables, compared with 99 in the Voyages Database available online. Users interested in working with this larger data set can download it in a file formatted for use with SPSS software. A variable in this dataset (EVGREEN) identifies voyages on the CD-ROM version published in 1999. Because some users may find it useful to view data as it existed in 1999, the CD-ROM version can also be selected for download. A codebook describing all variable names, variable labels, and values of the expanded dataset can be downloaded as a separate PDF document. With only a few exceptions, it retains variable names in the original 1999 CD-ROM version. The 2008 version of the database may also be downloaded.</p>\r\n<h3>Downloads:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Expanded dataset (2010, SPSS format): <a href=\"{{MEDIA_URL}}download/tastdb-exp-2010.sav\">tastdb-exp-2010.sav</a></li>\r\n<li>Expanded dataset (2008, SPSS format): <a href=\"{{ MEDIA_URL }}download/tastdb-exp-2008.sav\">tastdb-exp-2008.sav</a></li>\r\n<li>Original CD-ROM dataset (1999, SPSS format): <a href=\"{{ MEDIA_URL }}download/tastdb-1999.sav\">tastdb-1999.sav</a></li>\r\n<li>Codebook: <a href=\"{{MEDIA_URL}}download/Codebook2013_5-3_final.pdf\" target=\"blank\">SPSS codebook</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<a name=\"download2\"></a>&nbsp;\r\n<h2>The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database (Voyages data set)</h2>\r\n<p>This data set of the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database contains the 99 variables available through the Voyages Database on this website.

Du Bois Institute of Harvard University and the Wilberforce Institute for the Study of Slavery and Emancipation of the University of Hull have also supported its development.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id=\"section-titles\">\r\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"section-title\"><a href=\"../../../../../about/history\">History</a></td>\r\n<td class=\"section-title\"><a href=\"../../../../../about/team\">Project Team</a></td>\r\n<td class=\"section-title\"><a href=\"../../../../../about/data\">Contributors of data</a></td>\r\n<td class=\"section-title\"><a href=\"../../../../../about/acknowledgements\">Acknowledgements</a></td>\r\n<td class=\"section-title\"><a href=\"../../../../../about/origins\">African Origins Project</a></td>\r\n<td class=\"section-title\"><a href=\"../../../../../about/contacts\">Contact us</a></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id=\"section-descs\">\r\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"section-desc\">A brief account of the origins of a single multi-source dataset of the trans-Atlantic slave trade and its realization first as a CD-ROM published by Cambridge University Press in 1999 and now, in an expanded version, on the Voyages website.</td>\r\n<td class=\"section-desc\">Names of the principal investigators, of members of the project development team, and of individuals serving on the steering committee and advisory board.</td>\r\n<td class=\"section-desc\">Names of scholars and researchers whose findings on the trans-Atlantic slave trade have been incorporated into the Voyages Database.</td>\r\n<td class=\"section-desc\">Major sponsors and institutional partners of the Voyages website, as well as other organizations and individuals who have assisted the work of the project team.</td>\r\n<td class=\"section-desc\">A scholar-public collaborative project using audio recordings of names in African Names Database to trace the geographic origins of Africans transported in the transatlantic slave trade.</td>\r\n<td class=\"section-desc\">Members of the Voyages editorial board and the email address for contacting the website.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

From the late 1960s, Herbert S. Klein and other scholars began to collect archival data on slave-trading voyages from unpublished sources and to code them into a machine-readable format. In the 1970s and 1980s, scholars created a number of slave ship datasets, several of which the current authors chose to recode from the primary sources rather than integrate the datasets of those scholars into the present set. By the late 1980s, there were records of approximately 11,000 individual trans-Atlantic voyages in sixteen separate datasets, not all of which were trans-Atlantic, nor, as it turned out, slave voyages. And of course, some sets overlapped others. Several listings of voyages extracted from more than one source had appeared in hard copy form, notably three volumes of voyages from French ports published by Jean Mettas and Serge and Michelle Daget and two volumes of Bristol voyages (expanded to four by 1996) authored by David Richardson. The basis for each dataset was usually the records of a specific European nation or the particular port where slaving voyages originated, with the information available reflecting the nature of the records that had survived rather than the structure of the voyage itself. Scholars of the slave trade spent the first quarter century of the computer era working largely in isolation, each using one source only as well as a separate format, though the Curtin, Mettas, and Richardson collections were early exceptions to this pattern.</p>\r\n<p>The idea of creating a single multisource dataset of trans-Atlantic slave voyages emerged from a chance meeting of David Eltis and Stephen Behrendt in the British Public Record Office in 1990 while they were working independently on the early and late British slave trades. At about the same time, David Richardson was taking over detailed multisource work on the large mid-eighteenth-century Liverpool shipping business begun years earlier by Maurice Schofield. All this work, together with the Bristol volumes that Richardson had already published, made it seem feasible to integrate the records for the very large British slave trade for the first time, and beyond that, given the available Dutch, French, and Portuguese data, to collect a single dataset for the trade as a whole. Meetings in January, 1991 at the American Historical Association and, in 1992, at the W. E. B. Du Bois Institute for Afro-American Research at Harvard University, headed by Professor Henry L. Gates, Jr resulted in grant proposals to major funding agencies. In July 1993 the project received funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities with supplementary support coming from the Mellon Foundation.</p>\r\n<p>By the time the project began, Johannes Postma&rsquo;s Dutch data had become available (subsequently revised in 2003), as had Stephen Behrendt&rsquo;s compilation of the extensive British trade after 1779, and also the large and complex Richardson, Beedham, and Schofield pre-1787 Liverpool Plantation Register data set, all in machine-readable format. Quantities of smaller sets of published material available only in hard-copy form had been available for some time, and as awareness of the project increased, scholars volunteered unpublished data. In the course of the next three years, the project undertook three major tasks. The first was standardizing the existing data. Pioneers in the field had collected their data using different definitions of variables, sometimes of apparently similar items of information, as well as a range of organizational formats (for example using ship-based rather than voyage-based data). The second task was collating voyages which appeared in several different sets, converting single-source data sets into multisource equivalents and even checking on the validity of old compilations. The third task, which became increasingly important as the project progressed, was adding new information. About half of the 27,233 voyage records subsequently published on the 1999 CD-ROM in 1999 were new.</p>\r\n<p>Voyages is the product of a further great surge of information on the slave trade that has happened since 1999. Latin-American slaving expeditions were seriously under-represented on the CD-ROM, and, as a consequence, between 2001 and 2005 a major research initiative was undertaken in Portuguese and Spanish language archives around the Atlantic basins to address this deficiency. Three years of funding for this work (from 2002 to 2005) came from the Arts and Humanities Research Board of the United Kingdom and was administered through the University of Hull with David Richardson and David Eltis as the principal investigators. Manolo Florentino anchored the work in Rio de Janeiro, Roquinaldo Ferreira in Luanda, and Jelmer Vos in Lisbon, and other European archives. The major documentary collections explored in this period were in archives in Luanda, Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, Lisbon, Havana, Madrid, Sevilla, Amsterdam, Middelburg, Copenhagen, and London as well as the extensive eighteenth century newspaper holdings of the Bodleian and British Libraries. But while this was happening scholars unconnected with the project continued to give generously of their time and the archival data that they themselves had collected. While the range and depth of work completed before the year 2000 was impressive, the size and scope of this post-1999 research effort can be gauged by the fact that no less than sixty percent of the slave voyages in the Voyages Database contain information unavailable in 1999. As the core dataset expanded, and called on greater varieties of sources, the problem of double-counting grew ever larger and more complicated. In this period we reached the point at which almost as many resources had to be devoted to this as to gathering the data in the first place.</p>\r\n<p>The construction of the present open access web site, Voyages was made possible by yet a third major award in 2006, this one launched from Emory University. Once more the National Endowment for the Humanities was the source, but supplementary funding came from the W. E. B. Du Bois Institute for Afro-American Research at Harvard. While the research work continued during the two year period of these grants, the thrust of the effort shifted to presentation. The project team developed sophisticated search interfaces for three different kinds of data, as well as estimates of the size and direction of the trade. The web site would provide a range of ancillary material for educators including lesson plans and maps. Perhaps most important, the new site would provide an opportunity for researchers everywhere to continue to contribute their discoveries and correct errors in the data that they might find. After a peer-review process any new data or corrections will be added to the core database at three year intervals. It is difficult to think of any international project of preserving and reconstructing history which has depended more on collaboration than Voyages has. It is even harder to think of one that provides a better basis for such collaboration to continue into the future.</p>\r\n<div style=\"border-top: 1px solid #CCCCCC;\">\r\n<p>1 Franz Binder, Ernst van den Boogart, Henk den Heijer and Johannes Postma, James Pritchard, Andrea Weindl, Antonio de Almeida Mendes, Manuel Barcia Paz, Alexandre Ribeiro, David Wheat and Jos&eacute; Capela were among those making major contributions from data collected for their own research.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

With apologies for any regrettable omissions and our sincerest thanks to everyone, named or anonymous, who graciously gave their time and expertise, we would like to especially acknowledge the following individuals.</p>\r\n<p>Many individuals at Emory University&rsquo;s Robert W. Woodruff Library took time outside of their already busy schedules and routine work in order to answer our questions, assist with various project tasks, and generally support the life of the project. Rob Riley&rsquo;s early advice on and examples of database systems sparked ideas for our own database. Naomi Nelson and Teresa Burk of MARBL (<a href=\"http://marbl.library.emory.edu\">Manuscript, Archives, and Rare Book Library</a>) helped locate and prepare rare materials for digitizing as well as for various presentations on the project. Anne Frellsen, of the <a href=\"http://web.library.emory.edu/preservation\">Preservation Office at Emory University Libraries</a>, assisted also with digitizing efforts and met with members of our team to discuss best practices for photographing and digitizing historical artifacts. Lisa Macklin&rsquo;s advice on copyright helped guide the collection of images for the site. At the insistence of Lea McLees, the library&rsquo;s Director of Communications, we documented our work on the project &ndash; a task greatly aided by Francine Thurston, Matt Miller, and Sarah Toton, who all gave generously of their time and abilities in photography, videography, and video editing, respectively. Jim Kruse, Shannon O&rsquo;Daniel, and other members of both <a href=\"http://cet.emory.edu/ecit/\">Emory&rsquo;s Center for Interactive Teaching (ECIT)</a> and <a href=\"http://it.emory.edu/showdoc.cfm?docid=8129\">University Technology Services (UTS)</a> regularly and graciously gave their time, tools and resources, and expertise to help ensure that all team members &ndash; both on site and off &ndash; could fully participate in project meetings. Finally, Ginger Cain&rsquo;s enthusiasm and energy for sharing information about the project continues to put us in touch with new people interested in the project and new possibilities for continuing this work.</p>\r\n</div>",

With apologies for any regrettable omissions and our sincerest thanks to everyone, named or anonymous, who graciously gave their time and expertise, we would like to especially acknowledge the following individuals.</p>\r\n<p>Many individuals at Emory University&rsquo;s Robert W. Woodruff Library took time outside of their already busy schedules and routine work in order to answer our questions, assist with various project tasks, and generally support the life of the project. Rob Riley&rsquo;s early advice on and examples of database systems sparked ideas for our own database. Naomi Nelson and Teresa Burk of MARBL (<a href=\"http://marbl.library.emory.edu\">Manuscript, Archives, and Rare Book Library</a>) helped locate and prepare rare materials for digitizing as well as for various presentations on the project. Anne Frellsen, of the <a href=\"http://web.library.emory.edu/preservation\">Preservation Office at Emory University Libraries</a>, assisted also with digitizing efforts and met with members of our team to discuss best practices for photographing and digitizing historical artifacts. Lisa Macklin&rsquo;s advice on copyright helped guide the collection of images for the site. At the insistence of Lea McLees, the library&rsquo;s Director of Communications, we documented our work on the project &ndash; a task greatly aided by Francine Thurston, Matt Miller, and Sarah Toton, who all gave generously of their time and abilities in photography, videography, and video editing, respectively. Jim Kruse, Shannon O&rsquo;Daniel, and other members of both <a href=\"http://cet.emory.edu/ecit/\">Emory&rsquo;s Center for Interactive Teaching (ECIT)</a> and <a href=\"http://it.emory.edu/showdoc.cfm?docid=8129\">University Technology Services (UTS)</a> regularly and graciously gave their time, tools and resources, and expertise to help ensure that all team members &ndash; both on site and off &ndash; could fully participate in project meetings. Finally, Ginger Cain&rsquo;s enthusiasm and energy for sharing information about the project continues to put us in touch with new people interested in the project and new possibilities for continuing this work.</p>\r\n</div>",

African Origins seeks the help of members of the African diaspora, Africans, scholars, and others to identify the likely origins of these liberated Africans and thus begin to trace the migration histories of other Africans transported across the Atlantic during the 19<sup>th</sup> century suppression of the slave trade. Those with knowledge of African languages, cultural naming practices, and ethnic groups will assist in identifying these Africans&rsquo; origins by drawing on their own expertise to identify the likely ethno-linguistic origin of an individual&rsquo;s name.</p>\r\n<p>The African Origins Project arose directly from the work of G. Ugo Nwokeji and David Eltis, who in 2002 used audio recordings of names found in Courts of Mixed Commission records for Havana, Cuba, and Freetown, Sierra Leone, to identify likely ethno-linguistic origins. The names in these recordings were pronounced by speakers of the same language and accent that the Courts of Mixed Commission registrars would likely have had (e.g., if the name was written in a Havana register, Eltis and Nwokeji had the name pronounced by a Spanish speaker with a Havana accent). This helped connect the sound of the name to its spelling and thus enabled a more accurate assessment of the name&rsquo;s possible ethnic origins than provided by its written counterpart alone.</p>\r\n<p>Eltis and Nwokeji played these recordings to informants in Nigeria and to members of the African diaspora in parts of North America, who were able to identify through these pronunciations the likely ethnic group from which the name derived. Such one-on-one research with informants, though successful, proved highly time consuming and yielded little more than two identifications for each African in their dataset, and led to the pursuit of an online method of broadly soliciting volunteers to assist with this project.</p>\r\n<p>View digitized images of the first pages of the <a href=\"../../../../../resources/images/\">Sierra Leone and Cuba Courts of Mixed Commission registers</a>, from which the information on these Africans was drawn. An earlier database drawn from these sources called the African names database is available on the downloads page of this site. It contains data on stature that are not available on African-Origins. Information on liberated Africans and registers of the Courts of Mixed Commission may also be found in the Glossary.

Our reconstruction of a major part of this migration experience covers an era in which there was massive technological change (steamers were among the last slave ships), as well as very dramatic shifts in perceptions of good and evil. Just as important perhaps were the relations between the Western and non-Western worlds that the trade both reflected and encapsulated. Slaves constituted the most important reason for contact between Europeans and Africans for nearly two centuries. The shipment of slaves from Africa was related to the demographic disaster consequent to the meeting of Europeans and Amerindians, which greatly reduced the numbers of Amerindian laborers and raised the demand for labor drawn from elsewhere, particularly Africa. As Europeans colonized the Americas, a steady stream of European peoples migrated to the Americas between 1492 and the early nineteenth century. But what is often overlooked is that, before 1820, perhaps three times as many enslaved Africans crossed the Atlantic as Europeans. This was the largest transoceanic migration of a people until that day, and it provided the Americas with a crucial labor force for their own economic development. The slave trade is thus a vital part of the history of some millions of Africans and their descendants who helped shape the modern Americas culturally as well as in the material sense.</p>\r\n<p>The genesis and history of Voyages Database is laid out on a separate page. In this essay we wish to alert users to its structure and to its limitations as well as its strengths. The data set contains thousands of names of ship owners and ship captains, but it contains no names of the millions of slaves carried to the Americas. On the other hand, this web site does provide the African names of and personal information about 67,004 captives who were found on board slave vessels detained by naval cruisers attempting to suppress the slave trade in the nineteenth century. These people can be searched and analyzed using the names interface. Although of limited utility for persons seeking their own family histories, our data set does provide an extraordinary source for historical reconstruction of the history of the African peoples in America. The details of the 34,948 voyages presented here greatly facilitate the study of cultural, demographic, and economic change in the Atlantic world from the late sixteenth to the mid-nineteenth centuries. Trends and cycles in the flow of African captives from specific coastal outlets should provide scholars with new, basic information useful in examining the relationships among slaving, warfare&mdash;in both Africa and Europe&mdash;political instability, and climatic and ecological change, among other forces. The data set in its earlier manifestations has already provided new impetus to assessments of the volume and demographic structure of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, and, when the African Names Database is properly interpreted, it will contribute as well to our understanding of slaving routes from the African interior to the coast.</p>\r\n<p>For European societies located on either side of the Atlantic, the data set contains new information on ship construction and registration and relatively extensive records of owners&rsquo; and captains&rsquo; names. It will now be easier to pursue connections between the slave trade and other sectors of European and American economies. Researchers should be able to unravel trends in long-distance shipping activities, particularly important because no comparable body of data exists for other transoceanic trades. Data on crew mortality are abundant. The implications for new assessments of the social as well as the economic role of the slave trade in the regions where the slave voyage originated are obvious. In short, the major aim of this Emory supported Voyages web resource is to facilitate and stimulate new research on the slave trade, the implications of which reach far beyond the slave trade itself.</p>",

It is probable that our data set now includes more than 95 percent of all voyages that left British ports&mdash;and the British were the second largest of the national slave trader groups. The data on the eighteenth-century French and Dutch slave trades are also largely complete. The reasons for such comprehensive coverage are fairly obvious. Compared with other slave traders, northwestern European trading nations conducted the great bulk of their business relatively late in the slave trade era when everyone kept better records. Surviving sources in these countries are therefore abundant. Casual inspection of the relevant variables in the data set shows that almost all the voyages leaving ports in these countries have more than one source of information, and some have as many as eighteen. Yet the data on the Iberian and Brazilian trades after 1750 are also relatively complete, and information on the earlier period for these regions is vastly greater than it was ten years ago. For a country by country assessment of the completeness of the data, readers are referred to Chapter 1 of Extending the Frontiers and the spreadsheets downloadable from this web site that underpin our estimates of the overall size of the slave trade. Our estimate of the total volume of slaves carried off from Africa to the Americas is 12.5 million, and that the total number of voyages that set out to obtain captives was 43,600. New information will certainly emerge from the archives, but we think it unlikely that future scholars will dramatically increase the size or scale of the trans-Atlantic slave trade.</p>\r\n<p>The 34,948 trans-Atlantic voyages contained in the database allows us to infer the total number of voyages carrying slaves from Africa. The Estimates page suggests that 12 &frac12; million captives (12,520,000) departed Africa for the Americas. Dividing this total by the average number of people embarked per voyage, 304 individuals, yields 41,190 voyages. Similarly, the Estimates pages suggests that 10.7 million enslaved Africans disembarked, mainly in the Americas. Given the average number disembarked per voyage, 265 people, yields an estimated 40,380 voyages arriving. Not all 34,948 voyages in the database carried slaves from Africa. A total of 1,262 voyages (3.6%) never reached the African coast because they were lost at sea, captured or suffered some other misfortune. After removing these voyages, the database contains some trace of 81 percent of voyages that embarked captives. The database also contains records of 33,684 voyages that disembarked slaves, or could have done so (in other words, for some of these we do not know the outcome of the voyage). A total of 924 of these disembarked their slaves in the Old World. The latter group comprised mainly ships captured in the nineteenth century which were taken to Sierra Leone and St. Helena as part of the attempt to suppress the trade. A further 276 sank after leaving Africa with the loss of their slaves. In all, the database contains some record of almost 80 percent of vessels disembarking captives. Of course, there are other estimates of the volume of the trans-Atlantic slave trade. If we take a higher estimate of, say, 15.4 million departures,<span class=\"superscript\">(2)</span> then the Voyages Database documents two-thirds of all slaving voyages that sailed between 1514 and 1866.</p>",

The published data draw on a wide range of published and archival information. Postma, Mettas, and Richardson used new material in the preparation of their published catalogues of voyages. Our data set does not reproduce all the sources that previous authors used and listed. Thus, voyages drawn from published sources are represented here by that single reference to them alone. Anyone wishing to consult their archival references will have to look them up in the hard copy of these published volumes. We edited individual voyage details in these collections only when we found new documentary evidence to support a change; consequently, we added these new references to the source record. Pulling together the results of work carried out in separate national archives was particularly fruitful because trans-Atlantic slave vessels could clear from one jurisdiction and arrive in the Americas in another. Specifically, the international nature of the slave trade meant that a voyage that might appear primarily in one national body of records had a very good chance of showing up, in addition, in the records of other countries. Thus, voyages organized by London merchants operating independently of the Royal African Company (RAC) in the 1670s and 1680s obtained their slaves in South-east Africa, outside the RAC&rsquo;s English monopoly and where the English East India Company had little physical presence. Because almost all these ships called at the Cape before beginning their trans-Atlantic journeys, several of them appear in the Dutch Cape of Good Hope archives.<span class=\"superscript\">(3 )</span> Portuguese ships leaving Bahia in Brazil for the \"Mina\" coast appear in English Cape Coast Castle material at the Public Record Office. Slave ships of every nationality appear in Lloyd&rsquo;s Lists, and of course the hundreds of slave ships captured in the many European wars are often carefully documented in the archives of the captors, as well as in the records of the nations to which the ships belonged. Indeed, the South Atlantic Portuguese trade has fewer sources per voyage, precisely because this branch of the traffic operated independently of the others. Winds and ocean currents kept the South Atlantic trade out of the non-Portuguese archives, as well as keeping northern Europeans out of South Atlantic ports.</p>\r\n<p>Of the 34,948 voyages in the data set, 12,320 have only one source listed. In fact, more than half of these apparently single-source records are taken from already published material where, in nearly all cases, additional primary references are to be found. Furthermore, other publications on which the present data set draws, such as Coughtry&rsquo;s listing of Rhode Island voyages, are based on a range of primary documents which are not listed by voyage in the publication itself. After allowing for these multi-sourced single references, it would appear that perhaps only one in six of the 34,948 voyages are based on a single historical record. Sixty percent of the voyages in the set have three or more separate sources each. Researchers should no longer need to depend on data collected on the basis of a single source. Abbreviated reference to the sources for any particular voyage can be viewed in the results section of the database by clicking on &ldquo;configure columns&rdquo; and transferring &ldquo;sources&rdquo; from left box to the right box in the resulting window. The full reference may be viewed by rolling the cursor over the abbreviated source or by clicking on the row of a voyage to view voyage details. Alphabetic listings of references and full descriptions of locations are to be found in <a href=\"../sources/\">Home&gt; Voyages Database&gt; Understanding the database&gt; Sources .</a></p>\r\n<p>While the sources are relatively rich, diversity brings a new set of problems. We can hardly expect that reports on voyages made several thousand miles&mdash;as well as several months&mdash;apart, often in different languages and under different bureaucracies, each with a separate set of official procedures to follow, to always generate perfectly consistent information. For example, 216 voyages in the data set apparently arrived in the Americas with more slaves on board than when they left Africa. Others left port more than once on the same voyage, and some ships reportedly changed tonnage and even rig in the course of the voyage. The same ship occasionally appears under more than one name on the same voyage. Those used to working with a single source per voyage and generating data sets without any conflicting information should be warned that the editors have not attempted to correct all these problems. The data set offered here is by no means \"clean\" in the sense of being entirely internally consistent. We have pursued and eliminated many of the inconsistencies, but to eliminate all would have imposed an order on the historical record that anyone who has visited the archives (or indeed examined published sources such as Mettas or Richardson) knows does not exist. The editors always entered only one value per variable when faced with alternative information. In making such choices, we followed certain rules that researchers can change after going back to the sources. If users elect to do this, however, they, too, will have a set which is both not \"clean\" and not necessarily reflective of the historical records from which it is drawn.</p>",

The selection offered here has changed several times in the last six years and will no doubt change again in the future as interests shift. Each entry in our data set is a single voyage, assigned a unique identification number as the first of piece of information (VOYAGEID). The question of what voyages to include is also to some extent arbitrary. The term \"trans-Atlantic\" is less straightforward than it appears. Omitting ships sailing to the Mascarene Islands was an easy decision, but several French ships in the late eighteenth century began their slaving activities in the Indian Ocean, but then on the same voyage brought slaves to the Americas after selling some Africans in Bourbon and the Cape of Good Hope. What to do with the British ships that carried hundreds of children from the Upper Guinea coast to Lisbon in the mid-eighteenth century? These we included on the basis of length of voyage. Should one include the Portuguese trade to S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; in the Bight of Biafra&mdash;probably the most enduring branch of the Atlantic slave trade? (excluded on the same basis). Then there were the more than 1,200 slave ships engaged in trans-Atlantic voyages, nearly half with slaves on board, that the British captured and carried into Sierra Leone, the Cape of Good Hope, St. Helena, Fernando Po, or Luanda, before they were able to reach their intended American destinations. These we included. Or even more confusing, the 1,060 slaves awaiting shipment in barracoons in Ambriz, Angola, in May 1842, but carried off in British cruisers to St. Helena and Sierra Leone and never subjected to court proceedings of any kind, because they had never been on board a slave ship (excluded). <span class=\"superscript\">(4)</span> Limits had to be established, but the data set provides a basis for those who disagree with those limits to use our work to create their own data sets. A total of 65 variables are made available on the search the database interface, general category, and 293 variables are available in the downloadable version of the database. Users should note, though, that the website set combines all sources into one variable and the day, month, year values are also combined into one variable for each of the ten dates entered. The names of captives, names of Caribbean agents, names of crew other than captain, the details of shipboard insurrection, and much other information are not included in the present data set, but may be added fairly easily or linked with it via the unique voyage identification number and compares version 2008 of the database with version 2010.</p>\r\n<p>The database contains two broad types of variables: data variables and imputed variables. The largest group, 44 of those in the search interface, are data variables. They incorporate information collected from the sources. Imputed variables, indicated by an asterisk, are mainly imputed from knowledge of the relevant voyage or adjacent voyages, calculated directly from data encountered in archival or published sources, or inferred from patterns observed in data variables when not documented directly in primary sources. An example of an imputed variable is the &ldquo;Region of Slave Disembarkation Broadly Defined,&rdquo; a variable that allows one to group voyages to Jamaica or Cuba or St. Domingue into the broadly defined region &ldquo;Caribbean.&rdquo; In augmenting the number of voyages on which analysis can be conducted, the imputed variables produce more statistically significant results in using the options in the &ldquo;Search the database&rdquo; interface to create tables and custom graphs. They form the basis of the tables and graphs that users can build.</p>",

Furthermore, for some years there are inconsistencies in slave age or gender totals per voyage. Regarding slave exports, we were careful to distinguish between the number of slaves purchased and the number who in fact were shipped from the coast. We used slave departure totals, whether reported by slave traders, African merchants, or European captains, agents, or merchants. We included the slave departures reported in sources such as logs kept by the Dutch and English castles on the Gold Coast, even though the totals often were rounded numbers, such as 400 or 500 slaves, and even though the totals occasionally were significantly less than the numbers of slaves who were disembarked in the Americas. Users should keep these biases in mind, not least for any calculations of mortality they may wish to try. For slave arrivals recorded in customs documents or shipping gazettes, we decided to use maximum totals where there was conflicting information, under the assumption that these differences might indicate deaths of slaves before slaves disembarked.</p>",

Although 26,216 voyages in the data set arrived with slaves, and a further 7,192 could have done so, the sources provide the actual number on board at arrival for only 18,269 voyages. On the African side, the data are much weaker, with only 8,272 yielding information on the number of slaves leaving Africa, out of 29,095 voyages that left with slaves, and a further 3,335 that could have done so. Because most of those studying the slave trade are interested in the captives rather than the ships, some inference would seem appropriate for those ships that traded without leaving anything in the historical record about the slaves they carried. The first step in making reasonable inferences is to draw on the number of captives who might have been reported for the same voyage at an earlier or later stage of its itinerary.</p>\r\n<p>Only 5,803 voyages in the revised database contain numbers of both captives embarked and captives disembarked, but for a further 2,404 we have the figure for departures alone and for 12,279 numbers arrived alone. Imputed totals for the missing information may be made from the large subset of voyages that provide information on deaths during the passage. The Voyages Database contains 6,438 voyages for which a ratio of deaths to slaves embarked may be calculated. Deaths as a proportion of those embarked differed markedly by African region of embarkation. Table 2 shows breakdowns of shipboard mortality as a percentage of those slaves taken on board.</p>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Table 2.

Indeed, we do not even know if some of these ships carried slaves. The CD-ROM database divided such unknowns into just two groups, one sailing from North American ports and the other departing from all other ports in the Atlantic. Behind such categorization was the recognition that the slave vessels from North America were substantially smaller than the average. Separate means were calculated for the two groups, adjusted in the case of the larger group for region of embarkation in Africa where this information was available. In the Voyages Database a more refined strategy is adopted. A more complete data set now allows us to focus on the type of vessel as well as the route the voyage followed in forming estimates of captives transported where such information is missing. The number of captives on board was very much a function of the type of ship as well as place of trade in Africa, and to a lesser extent in the Americas. Moreover, the size of the type of vessel as reflected in its rig changed over time. The Appendix table attempts to take into account these factors by showing average number of captives both embarked and disembarked for 155 separate combinations of first, rig of vessel and time period; and second, where these were not available, place of trade in Africa; and third, a separate grouping of 18 types of vessels &ndash; smaller than those from the rest of the Atlantic World before 1800 - built in North America. A small group of vessels have no information on either rig or place of trade and estimates of captives for these are classed as &ldquo;No rig&rdquo; in the Appendix table. The means for these 155 categories were added to voyage records, as appropriate, whenever data on slaves could not be extracted from the sources. Users should note that in all cases these averages might be termed &ldquo;running&rdquo; in the sense that that as we added data to the database we recalculated the statistics reported in the Appendix table. And as augmentation of the dataset is set to continue then the imputed values will vary as data are added in the future. Users should thus not expect to find that the imputed values assigned to any given ship type are always the same or, indeed, will remain the same.</p>",

Our reconstruction of a major part of this migration experience covers an era in which there was massive technological change (steamers were among the last slave ships), as well as very dramatic shifts in perceptions of good and evil. Just as important perhaps were the relations between the Western and non-Western worlds that the trade both reflected and encapsulated. Slaves constituted the most important reason for contact between Europeans and Africans for nearly two centuries. The shipment of slaves from Africa was related to the demographic disaster consequent to the meeting of Europeans and Amerindians, which greatly reduced the numbers of Amerindian laborers and raised the demand for labor drawn from elsewhere, particularly Africa. As Europeans colonized the Americas, a steady stream of European peoples migrated to the Americas between 1492 and the early nineteenth century. But what is often overlooked is that, before 1820, perhaps three times as many enslaved Africans crossed the Atlantic as Europeans. This was the largest transoceanic migration of a people until that day, and it provided the Americas with a crucial labor force for their own economic development. The slave trade is thus a vital part of the history of some millions of Africans and their descendants who helped shape the modern Americas culturally as well as in the material sense.</p>\r\n<p>The genesis and history of Voyages Database is laid out on a separate page. In this essay we wish to alert users to its structure and to its limitations as well as its strengths. The data set contains thousands of names of ship owners and ship captains, but it contains no names of the millions of slaves carried to the Americas. On the other hand, this web site does provide the African names of and personal information about 67,004 captives who were found on board slave vessels detained by naval cruisers attempting to suppress the slave trade in the nineteenth century. These people can be searched and analyzed using the names interface. Although of limited utility for persons seeking their own family histories, our data set does provide an extraordinary source for historical reconstruction of the history of the African peoples in America. The details of the 34,948 voyages presented here greatly facilitate the study of cultural, demographic, and economic change in the Atlantic world from the late sixteenth to the mid-nineteenth centuries. Trends and cycles in the flow of African captives from specific coastal outlets should provide scholars with new, basic information useful in examining the relationships among slaving, warfare&mdash;in both Africa and Europe&mdash;political instability, and climatic and ecological change, among other forces. The data set in its earlier manifestations has already provided new impetus to assessments of the volume and demographic structure of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, and, when the African Names Database is properly interpreted, it will contribute as well to our understanding of slaving routes from the African interior to the coast.</p>\r\n<p>For European societies located on either side of the Atlantic, the data set contains new information on ship construction and registration and relatively extensive records of owners&rsquo; and captains&rsquo; names. It will now be easier to pursue connections between the slave trade and other sectors of European and American economies. Researchers should be able to unravel trends in long-distance shipping activities, particularly important because no comparable body of data exists for other transoceanic trades. Data on crew mortality are abundant. The implications for new assessments of the social as well as the economic role of the slave trade in the regions where the slave voyage originated are obvious. In short, the major aim of this Emory supported Voyages web resource is to facilitate and stimulate new research on the slave trade, the implications of which reach far beyond the slave trade itself.</p>",

Although 26,216 voyages in the data set arrived with slaves, and a further 7,192 could have done so, the sources provide the actual number on board at arrival for only 18,269 voyages. On the African side, the data are much weaker, with only 8,272 yielding information on the number of slaves leaving Africa, out of 29,095 voyages that left with slaves, and a further 3,335 that could have done so. Because most of those studying the slave trade are interested in the captives rather than the ships, some inference would seem appropriate for those ships that traded without leaving anything in the historical record about the slaves they carried. The first step in making reasonable inferences is to draw on the number of captives who might have been reported for the same voyage at an earlier or later stage of its itinerary.</p>\r\n<p>Only 5,803 voyages in the revised database contain numbers of both captives embarked and captives disembarked, but for a further 2,404 we have the figure for departures alone and for 12,279 numbers arrived alone. Imputed totals for the missing information may be made from the large subset of voyages that provide information on deaths during the passage. The Voyages Database contains 6,438 voyages for which a ratio of deaths to slaves embarked may be calculated. Deaths as a proportion of those embarked differed markedly by African region of embarkation. Table 2 shows breakdowns of shipboard mortality as a percentage of those slaves taken on board.</p>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Table 2.

Indeed, we do not even know if some of these ships carried slaves. The CD-ROM database divided such unknowns into just two groups, one sailing from North American ports and the other departing from all other ports in the Atlantic. Behind such categorization was the recognition that the slave vessels from North America were substantially smaller than the average. Separate means were calculated for the two groups, adjusted in the case of the larger group for region of embarkation in Africa where this information was available. In the Voyages Database a more refined strategy is adopted. A more complete data set now allows us to focus on the type of vessel as well as the route the voyage followed in forming estimates of captives transported where such information is missing. The number of captives on board was very much a function of the type of ship as well as place of trade in Africa, and to a lesser extent in the Americas. Moreover, the size of the type of vessel as reflected in its rig changed over time. The Appendix table attempts to take into account these factors by showing average number of captives both embarked and disembarked for 155 separate combinations of first, rig of vessel and time period; and second, where these were not available, place of trade in Africa; and third, a separate grouping of 18 types of vessels &ndash; smaller than those from the rest of the Atlantic World before 1800 - built in North America. A small group of vessels have no information on either rig or place of trade and estimates of captives for these are classed as &ldquo;No rig&rdquo; in the Appendix table. The means for these 155 categories were added to voyage records, as appropriate, whenever data on slaves could not be extracted from the sources. Users should note that in all cases these averages might be termed &ldquo;running&rdquo; in the sense that that as we added data to the database we recalculated the statistics reported in the Appendix table. And as augmentation of the dataset is set to continue then the imputed values will vary as data are added in the future. Users should thus not expect to find that the imputed values assigned to any given ship type are always the same or, indeed, will remain the same.</p>",

It is probable that our data set now includes more than 95 percent of all voyages that left British ports&mdash;and the British were the second largest of the national slave trader groups. The data on the eighteenth-century French and Dutch slave trades are also largely complete. The reasons for such comprehensive coverage are fairly obvious. Compared with other slave traders, northwestern European trading nations conducted the great bulk of their business relatively late in the slave trade era when everyone kept better records. Surviving sources in these countries are therefore abundant. Casual inspection of the relevant variables in the data set shows that almost all the voyages leaving ports in these countries have more than one source of information, and some have as many as eighteen. Yet the data on the Iberian and Brazilian trades after 1750 are also relatively complete, and information on the earlier period for these regions is vastly greater than it was ten years ago. For a country by country assessment of the completeness of the data, readers are referred to Chapter 1 of Extending the Frontiers and the spreadsheets downloadable from this web site that underpin our estimates of the overall size of the slave trade. Our estimate of the total volume of slaves carried off from Africa to the Americas is 12.5 million, and that the total number of voyages that set out to obtain captives was 43,600. New information will certainly emerge from the archives, but we think it unlikely that future scholars will dramatically increase the size or scale of the trans-Atlantic slave trade.</p>\r\n<p>The 34,948 trans-Atlantic voyages contained in the database allows us to infer the total number of voyages carrying slaves from Africa. The Estimates page suggests that 12 &frac12; million captives (12,520,000) departed Africa for the Americas. Dividing this total by the average number of people embarked per voyage, 304 individuals, yields 41,190 voyages. Similarly, the Estimates pages suggests that 10.7 million enslaved Africans disembarked, mainly in the Americas. Given the average number disembarked per voyage, 265 people, yields an estimated 40,380 voyages arriving. Not all 34,948 voyages in the database carried slaves from Africa. A total of 1,262 voyages (3.6%) never reached the African coast because they were lost at sea, captured or suffered some other misfortune. After removing these voyages, the database contains some trace of 81 percent of voyages that embarked captives. The database also contains records of 33,684 voyages that disembarked slaves, or could have done so (in other words, for some of these we do not know the outcome of the voyage). A total of 924 of these disembarked their slaves in the Old World. The latter group comprised mainly ships captured in the nineteenth century which were taken to Sierra Leone and St. Helena as part of the attempt to suppress the trade. A further 276 sank after leaving Africa with the loss of their slaves. In all, the database contains some record of almost 80 percent of vessels disembarking captives. Of course, there are other estimates of the volume of the trans-Atlantic slave trade. If we take a higher estimate of, say, 15.4 million departures,<span class=\"superscript\">(2)</span> then the Voyages Database documents two-thirds of all slaving voyages that sailed between 1514 and 1866.</p>",

The published data draw on a wide range of published and archival information. Postma, Mettas, and Richardson used new material in the preparation of their published catalogues of voyages. Our data set does not reproduce all the sources that previous authors used and listed. Thus, voyages drawn from published sources are represented here by that single reference to them alone. Anyone wishing to consult their archival references will have to look them up in the hard copy of these published volumes. We edited individual voyage details in these collections only when we found new documentary evidence to support a change; consequently, we added these new references to the source record. Pulling together the results of work carried out in separate national archives was particularly fruitful because trans-Atlantic slave vessels could clear from one jurisdiction and arrive in the Americas in another. Specifically, the international nature of the slave trade meant that a voyage that might appear primarily in one national body of records had a very good chance of showing up, in addition, in the records of other countries. Thus, voyages organized by London merchants operating independently of the Royal African Company (RAC) in the 1670s and 1680s obtained their slaves in South-east Africa, outside the RAC&rsquo;s English monopoly and where the English East India Company had little physical presence. Because almost all these ships called at the Cape before beginning their trans-Atlantic journeys, several of them appear in the Dutch Cape of Good Hope archives.<span class=\"superscript\">(3 )</span> Portuguese ships leaving Bahia in Brazil for the \"Mina\" coast appear in English Cape Coast Castle material at the Public Record Office. Slave ships of every nationality appear in Lloyd&rsquo;s Lists, and of course the hundreds of slave ships captured in the many European wars are often carefully documented in the archives of the captors, as well as in the records of the nations to which the ships belonged. Indeed, the South Atlantic Portuguese trade has fewer sources per voyage, precisely because this branch of the traffic operated independently of the others. Winds and ocean currents kept the South Atlantic trade out of the non-Portuguese archives, as well as keeping northern Europeans out of South Atlantic ports.</p>\r\n<p>Of the 34,948 voyages in the data set, 12,320 have only one source listed. In fact, more than half of these apparently single-source records are taken from already published material where, in nearly all cases, additional primary references are to be found. Furthermore, other publications on which the present data set draws, such as Coughtry&rsquo;s listing of Rhode Island voyages, are based on a range of primary documents which are not listed by voyage in the publication itself. After allowing for these multi-sourced single references, it would appear that perhaps only one in six of the 34,948 voyages are based on a single historical record. Sixty percent of the voyages in the set have three or more separate sources each. Researchers should no longer need to depend on data collected on the basis of a single source. Abbreviated reference to the sources for any particular voyage can be viewed in the results section of the database by clicking on &ldquo;configure columns&rdquo; and transferring &ldquo;sources&rdquo; from left box to the right box in the resulting window. The full reference may be viewed by rolling the cursor over the abbreviated source or by clicking on the row of a voyage to view voyage details. Alphabetic listings of references and full descriptions of locations are to be found in <a href=\"../sources/\">Home&gt; Voyages Database&gt; Understanding the database&gt; Sources .</a></p>\r\n<p>While the sources are relatively rich, diversity brings a new set of problems. We can hardly expect that reports on voyages made several thousand miles&mdash;as well as several months&mdash;apart, often in different languages and under different bureaucracies, each with a separate set of official procedures to follow, to always generate perfectly consistent information. For example, 216 voyages in the data set apparently arrived in the Americas with more slaves on board than when they left Africa. Others left port more than once on the same voyage, and some ships reportedly changed tonnage and even rig in the course of the voyage. The same ship occasionally appears under more than one name on the same voyage. Those used to working with a single source per voyage and generating data sets without any conflicting information should be warned that the editors have not attempted to correct all these problems. The data set offered here is by no means \"clean\" in the sense of being entirely internally consistent. We have pursued and eliminated many of the inconsistencies, but to eliminate all would have imposed an order on the historical record that anyone who has visited the archives (or indeed examined published sources such as Mettas or Richardson) knows does not exist. The editors always entered only one value per variable when faced with alternative information. In making such choices, we followed certain rules that researchers can change after going back to the sources. If users elect to do this, however, they, too, will have a set which is both not \"clean\" and not necessarily reflective of the historical records from which it is drawn.</p>",

The selection offered here has changed several times in the last six years and will no doubt change again in the future as interests shift. Each entry in our data set is a single voyage, assigned a unique identification number as the first of piece of information (VOYAGEID). The question of what voyages to include is also to some extent arbitrary. The term \"trans-Atlantic\" is less straightforward than it appears. Omitting ships sailing to the Mascarene Islands was an easy decision, but several French ships in the late eighteenth century began their slaving activities in the Indian Ocean, but then on the same voyage brought slaves to the Americas after selling some Africans in Bourbon and the Cape of Good Hope. What to do with the British ships that carried hundreds of children from the Upper Guinea coast to Lisbon in the mid-eighteenth century? These we included on the basis of length of voyage. Should one include the Portuguese trade to S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; in the Bight of Biafra&mdash;probably the most enduring branch of the Atlantic slave trade? (excluded on the same basis). Then there were the more than 1,200 slave ships engaged in trans-Atlantic voyages, nearly half with slaves on board, that the British captured and carried into Sierra Leone, the Cape of Good Hope, St. Helena, Fernando Po, or Luanda, before they were able to reach their intended American destinations. These we included. Or even more confusing, the 1,060 slaves awaiting shipment in barracoons in Ambriz, Angola, in May 1842, but carried off in British cruisers to St. Helena and Sierra Leone and never subjected to court proceedings of any kind, because they had never been on board a slave ship (excluded). <span class=\"superscript\">(4)</span> Limits had to be established, but the data set provides a basis for those who disagree with those limits to use our work to create their own data sets. A total of 65 variables are made available on the search the database interface, general category, and 293 variables are available in the downloadable version of the database. Users should note, though, that the website set combines all sources into one variable and the day, month, year values are also combined into one variable for each of the ten dates entered. The names of captives, names of Caribbean agents, names of crew other than captain, the details of shipboard insurrection, and much other information are not included in the present data set, but may be added fairly easily or linked with it via the unique voyage identification number and compares version 2008 of the database with version 2010.</p>\r\n<p>The database contains two broad types of variables: data variables and imputed variables. The largest group, 44 of those in the search interface, are data variables. They incorporate information collected from the sources. Imputed variables, indicated by an asterisk, are mainly imputed from knowledge of the relevant voyage or adjacent voyages, calculated directly from data encountered in archival or published sources, or inferred from patterns observed in data variables when not documented directly in primary sources. An example of an imputed variable is the &ldquo;Region of Slave Disembarkation Broadly Defined,&rdquo; a variable that allows one to group voyages to Jamaica or Cuba or St. Domingue into the broadly defined region &ldquo;Caribbean.&rdquo; In augmenting the number of voyages on which analysis can be conducted, the imputed variables produce more statistically significant results in using the options in the &ldquo;Search the database&rdquo; interface to create tables and custom graphs. They form the basis of the tables and graphs that users can build.</p>",

Furthermore, for some years there are inconsistencies in slave age or gender totals per voyage. Regarding slave exports, we were careful to distinguish between the number of slaves purchased and the number who in fact were shipped from the coast. We used slave departure totals, whether reported by slave traders, African merchants, or European captains, agents, or merchants. We included the slave departures reported in sources such as logs kept by the Dutch and English castles on the Gold Coast, even though the totals often were rounded numbers, such as 400 or 500 slaves, and even though the totals occasionally were significantly less than the numbers of slaves who were disembarked in the Americas. Users should keep these biases in mind, not least for any calculations of mortality they may wish to try. For slave arrivals recorded in customs documents or shipping gazettes, we decided to use maximum totals where there was conflicting information, under the assumption that these differences might indicate deaths of slaves before slaves disembarked.</p>",

However, since 2008, several hundred corrections have been made and additional information added. Thus 86 of the 2008 voyages have been deleted either because we found they had been entered twice, or because we discovered that a voyage was not involved in the transatlantic slave trade. Voyage id 16772, the Pye, Captain Adam, turned out to have carried slaves from Jamaica to the Chesapeake, but obtained its captives in Jamaica, not Africa. Offsetting the deletions are 94 voyages added on the basis of new information. Further many voyages that are common to both 2008 and 2010 versions of the database contain information that was not available in 2008 (see table 1 of &ldquo;Understanding the Database&rdquo;). The 2010 version has 276 variables, compared with 99 in the Voyages Database available online. Users interested in working with this larger data set can download it in a file formatted for use with SPSS software. A variable in this dataset (EVGREEN) identifies voyages on the CD-ROM version published in 1999. Because some users may find it useful to view data as it existed in 1999, the CD-ROM version can also be selected for download. A codebook describing all variable names, variable labels, and values of the expanded dataset can be downloaded as a separate PDF document. With only a few exceptions, it retains variable names in the original 1999 CD-ROM version. The 2008 version of the database may also be downloaded.</p>\r\n<h3>Downloads:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Expanded dataset (2010, SPSS format): <a href=\"{{MEDIA_URL}}download/tastdb-exp-2010.sav\">tastdb-exp-2010.sav</a></li>\r\n<li>Expanded dataset (2008, SPSS format): <a href=\"{{ MEDIA_URL }}download/tastdb-exp-2008.sav\">tastdb-exp-2008.sav</a></li>\r\n<li>Original CD-ROM dataset (1999, SPSS format): <a href=\"{{ MEDIA_URL }}download/tastdb-1999.sav\">tastdb-1999.sav</a></li>\r\n<li>Codebook: <a href=\"{{MEDIA_URL}}download/Codebook2013_5-3_final.pdf\" target=\"blank\">SPSS codebook</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<a name=\"download2\"></a>&nbsp;\r\n<h2>The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database (Voyages data set)</h2>\r\n<p>This data set of the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database contains the 99 variables available through the Voyages Database on this website.

Du Bois Institute of Harvard University and the Wilberforce Institute for the Study of Slavery and Emancipation of the University of Hull have also supported its development.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id=\"section-titles\">\r\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"section-title\"><a href=\"../../../../../about/history\">History</a></td>\r\n<td class=\"section-title\"><a href=\"../../../../../about/team\">Project Team</a></td>\r\n<td class=\"section-title\"><a href=\"../../../../../about/data\">Contributors of data</a></td>\r\n<td class=\"section-title\"><a href=\"../../../../../about/acknowledgements\">Acknowledgements</a></td>\r\n<td class=\"section-title\"><a href=\"../../../../../about/origins\">African Origins Project</a></td>\r\n<td class=\"section-title\"><a href=\"../../../../../about/contacts\">Contact us</a></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id=\"section-descs\">\r\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"section-desc\">A brief account of the origins of a single multi-source dataset of the trans-Atlantic slave trade and its realization first as a CD-ROM published by Cambridge University Press in 1999 and now, in an expanded version, on the Voyages website.</td>\r\n<td class=\"section-desc\">Names of the principal investigators, of members of the project development team, and of individuals serving on the steering committee and advisory board.</td>\r\n<td class=\"section-desc\">Names of scholars and researchers whose findings on the trans-Atlantic slave trade have been incorporated into the Voyages Database.</td>\r\n<td class=\"section-desc\">Major sponsors and institutional partners of the Voyages website, as well as other organizations and individuals who have assisted the work of the project team.</td>\r\n<td class=\"section-desc\">A scholar-public collaborative project using audio recordings of names in African Names Database to trace the geographic origins of Africans transported in the transatlantic slave trade.</td>\r\n<td class=\"section-desc\">Members of the Voyages editorial board and the email address for contacting the website.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

From the late 1960s, Herbert S. Klein and other scholars began to collect archival data on slave-trading voyages from unpublished sources and to code them into a machine-readable format. In the 1970s and 1980s, scholars created a number of slave ship datasets, several of which the current authors chose to recode from the primary sources rather than integrate the datasets of those scholars into the present set. By the late 1980s, there were records of approximately 11,000 individual trans-Atlantic voyages in sixteen separate datasets, not all of which were trans-Atlantic, nor, as it turned out, slave voyages. And of course, some sets overlapped others. Several listings of voyages extracted from more than one source had appeared in hard copy form, notably three volumes of voyages from French ports published by Jean Mettas and Serge and Michelle Daget and two volumes of Bristol voyages (expanded to four by 1996) authored by David Richardson. The basis for each dataset was usually the records of a specific European nation or the particular port where slaving voyages originated, with the information available reflecting the nature of the records that had survived rather than the structure of the voyage itself. Scholars of the slave trade spent the first quarter century of the computer era working largely in isolation, each using one source only as well as a separate format, though the Curtin, Mettas, and Richardson collections were early exceptions to this pattern.</p>\r\n<p>The idea of creating a single multisource dataset of trans-Atlantic slave voyages emerged from a chance meeting of David Eltis and Stephen Behrendt in the British Public Record Office in 1990 while they were working independently on the early and late British slave trades. At about the same time, David Richardson was taking over detailed multisource work on the large mid-eighteenth-century Liverpool shipping business begun years earlier by Maurice Schofield. All this work, together with the Bristol volumes that Richardson had already published, made it seem feasible to integrate the records for the very large British slave trade for the first time, and beyond that, given the available Dutch, French, and Portuguese data, to collect a single dataset for the trade as a whole. Meetings in January, 1991 at the American Historical Association and, in 1992, at the W. E. B. Du Bois Institute for Afro-American Research at Harvard University, headed by Professor Henry L. Gates, Jr resulted in grant proposals to major funding agencies. In July 1993 the project received funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities with supplementary support coming from the Mellon Foundation.</p>\r\n<p>By the time the project began, Johannes Postma&rsquo;s Dutch data had become available (subsequently revised in 2003), as had Stephen Behrendt&rsquo;s compilation of the extensive British trade after 1779, and also the large and complex Richardson, Beedham, and Schofield pre-1787 Liverpool Plantation Register data set, all in machine-readable format. Quantities of smaller sets of published material available only in hard-copy form had been available for some time, and as awareness of the project increased, scholars volunteered unpublished data. In the course of the next three years, the project undertook three major tasks. The first was standardizing the existing data. Pioneers in the field had collected their data using different definitions of variables, sometimes of apparently similar items of information, as well as a range of organizational formats (for example using ship-based rather than voyage-based data). The second task was collating voyages which appeared in several different sets, converting single-source data sets into multisource equivalents and even checking on the validity of old compilations. The third task, which became increasingly important as the project progressed, was adding new information. About half of the 27,233 voyage records subsequently published on the 1999 CD-ROM in 1999 were new.</p>\r\n<p>Voyages is the product of a further great surge of information on the slave trade that has happened since 1999. Latin-American slaving expeditions were seriously under-represented on the CD-ROM, and, as a consequence, between 2001 and 2005 a major research initiative was undertaken in Portuguese and Spanish language archives around the Atlantic basins to address this deficiency. Three years of funding for this work (from 2002 to 2005) came from the Arts and Humanities Research Board of the United Kingdom and was administered through the University of Hull with David Richardson and David Eltis as the principal investigators. Manolo Florentino anchored the work in Rio de Janeiro, Roquinaldo Ferreira in Luanda, and Jelmer Vos in Lisbon, and other European archives. The major documentary collections explored in this period were in archives in Luanda, Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, Lisbon, Havana, Madrid, Sevilla, Amsterdam, Middelburg, Copenhagen, and London as well as the extensive eighteenth century newspaper holdings of the Bodleian and British Libraries. But while this was happening scholars unconnected with the project continued to give generously of their time and the archival data that they themselves had collected. While the range and depth of work completed before the year 2000 was impressive, the size and scope of this post-1999 research effort can be gauged by the fact that no less than sixty percent of the slave voyages in the Voyages Database contain information unavailable in 1999. As the core dataset expanded, and called on greater varieties of sources, the problem of double-counting grew ever larger and more complicated. In this period we reached the point at which almost as many resources had to be devoted to this as to gathering the data in the first place.</p>\r\n<p>The construction of the present open access web site, Voyages was made possible by yet a third major award in 2006, this one launched from Emory University. Once more the National Endowment for the Humanities was the source, but supplementary funding came from the W. E. B. Du Bois Institute for Afro-American Research at Harvard. While the research work continued during the two year period of these grants, the thrust of the effort shifted to presentation. The project team developed sophisticated search interfaces for three different kinds of data, as well as estimates of the size and direction of the trade. The web site would provide a range of ancillary material for educators including lesson plans and maps. Perhaps most important, the new site would provide an opportunity for researchers everywhere to continue to contribute their discoveries and correct errors in the data that they might find. After a peer-review process any new data or corrections will be added to the core database at three year intervals. It is difficult to think of any international project of preserving and reconstructing history which has depended more on collaboration than Voyages has. It is even harder to think of one that provides a better basis for such collaboration to continue into the future.</p>\r\n<div style=\"border-top: 1px solid #CCCCCC;\">\r\n<p>1 Franz Binder, Ernst van den Boogart, Henk den Heijer and Johannes Postma, James Pritchard, Andrea Weindl, Antonio de Almeida Mendes, Manuel Barcia Paz, Alexandre Ribeiro, David Wheat and Jos&eacute; Capela were among those making major contributions from data collected for their own research.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

With apologies for any regrettable omissions and our sincerest thanks to everyone, named or anonymous, who graciously gave their time and expertise, we would like to especially acknowledge the following individuals.</p>\r\n<p>Many individuals at Emory University&rsquo;s Robert W. Woodruff Library took time outside of their already busy schedules and routine work in order to answer our questions, assist with various project tasks, and generally support the life of the project. Rob Riley&rsquo;s early advice on and examples of database systems sparked ideas for our own database. Naomi Nelson and Teresa Burk of MARBL (<a href=\"http://marbl.library.emory.edu\">Manuscript, Archives, and Rare Book Library</a>) helped locate and prepare rare materials for digitizing as well as for various presentations on the project. Anne Frellsen, of the <a href=\"http://web.library.emory.edu/preservation\">Preservation Office at Emory University Libraries</a>, assisted also with digitizing efforts and met with members of our team to discuss best practices for photographing and digitizing historical artifacts. Lisa Macklin&rsquo;s advice on copyright helped guide the collection of images for the site. At the insistence of Lea McLees, the library&rsquo;s Director of Communications, we documented our work on the project &ndash; a task greatly aided by Francine Thurston, Matt Miller, and Sarah Toton, who all gave generously of their time and abilities in photography, videography, and video editing, respectively. Jim Kruse, Shannon O&rsquo;Daniel, and other members of both <a href=\"http://cet.emory.edu/ecit/\">Emory&rsquo;s Center for Interactive Teaching (ECIT)</a> and <a href=\"http://it.emory.edu/showdoc.cfm?docid=8129\">University Technology Services (UTS)</a> regularly and graciously gave their time, tools and resources, and expertise to help ensure that all team members &ndash; both on site and off &ndash; could fully participate in project meetings. Finally, Ginger Cain&rsquo;s enthusiasm and energy for sharing information about the project continues to put us in touch with new people interested in the project and new possibilities for continuing this work.</p>\r\n</div>",

With apologies for any regrettable omissions and our sincerest thanks to everyone, named or anonymous, who graciously gave their time and expertise, we would like to especially acknowledge the following individuals.</p>\r\n<p>Many individuals at Emory University&rsquo;s Robert W. Woodruff Library took time outside of their already busy schedules and routine work in order to answer our questions, assist with various project tasks, and generally support the life of the project. Rob Riley&rsquo;s early advice on and examples of database systems sparked ideas for our own database. Naomi Nelson and Teresa Burk of MARBL (<a href=\"http://marbl.library.emory.edu\">Manuscript, Archives, and Rare Book Library</a>) helped locate and prepare rare materials for digitizing as well as for various presentations on the project. Anne Frellsen, of the <a href=\"http://web.library.emory.edu/preservation\">Preservation Office at Emory University Libraries</a>, assisted also with digitizing efforts and met with members of our team to discuss best practices for photographing and digitizing historical artifacts. Lisa Macklin&rsquo;s advice on copyright helped guide the collection of images for the site. At the insistence of Lea McLees, the library&rsquo;s Director of Communications, we documented our work on the project &ndash; a task greatly aided by Francine Thurston, Matt Miller, and Sarah Toton, who all gave generously of their time and abilities in photography, videography, and video editing, respectively. Jim Kruse, Shannon O&rsquo;Daniel, and other members of both <a href=\"http://cet.emory.edu/ecit/\">Emory&rsquo;s Center for Interactive Teaching (ECIT)</a> and <a href=\"http://it.emory.edu/showdoc.cfm?docid=8129\">University Technology Services (UTS)</a> regularly and graciously gave their time, tools and resources, and expertise to help ensure that all team members &ndash; both on site and off &ndash; could fully participate in project meetings. Finally, Ginger Cain&rsquo;s enthusiasm and energy for sharing information about the project continues to put us in touch with new people interested in the project and new possibilities for continuing this work.</p>\r\n</div>",

African Origins seeks the help of members of the African diaspora, Africans, scholars, and others to identify the likely origins of these liberated Africans and thus begin to trace the migration histories of other Africans transported across the Atlantic during the 19<sup>th</sup> century suppression of the slave trade. Those with knowledge of African languages, cultural naming practices, and ethnic groups will assist in identifying these Africans&rsquo; origins by drawing on their own expertise to identify the likely ethno-linguistic origin of an individual&rsquo;s name.</p>\r\n<p>The African Origins Project arose directly from the work of G. Ugo Nwokeji and David Eltis, who in 2002 used audio recordings of names found in Courts of Mixed Commission records for Havana, Cuba, and Freetown, Sierra Leone, to identify likely ethno-linguistic origins. The names in these recordings were pronounced by speakers of the same language and accent that the Courts of Mixed Commission registrars would likely have had (e.g., if the name was written in a Havana register, Eltis and Nwokeji had the name pronounced by a Spanish speaker with a Havana accent). This helped connect the sound of the name to its spelling and thus enabled a more accurate assessment of the name&rsquo;s possible ethnic origins than provided by its written counterpart alone.</p>\r\n<p>Eltis and Nwokeji played these recordings to informants in Nigeria and to members of the African diaspora in parts of North America, who were able to identify through these pronunciations the likely ethnic group from which the name derived. Such one-on-one research with informants, though successful, proved highly time consuming and yielded little more than two identifications for each African in their dataset, and led to the pursuit of an online method of broadly soliciting volunteers to assist with this project.</p>\r\n<p>View digitized images of the first pages of the <a href=\"../../../../../resources/images/\">Sierra Leone and Cuba Courts of Mixed Commission registers</a>, from which the information on these Africans was drawn. An earlier database drawn from these sources called the African names database is available on the downloads page of this site. It contains data on stature that are not available on African-Origins. Information on liberated Africans and registers of the Courts of Mixed Commission may also be found in the Glossary.
